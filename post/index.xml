          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;This Is Running For Your Life in June 2017&lt;/strong&gt;. A tedious read showing the personal feelings of an upper middle-class white Canadian woman who moved to New York to start a career as an art critic. However, most of the essays here are of the lifestyle magazine variety. Why some women are compelled to write about their Marilyn Monroe fixation is beyond my understanding. Courting living or dead celebrities with intellectualized feelings is garbage writing. Her essay on her grandmother lacks cognizance of intimacy evincing her emotional coldness. Just another upward class mobility stooge, and it is very alone at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;Good to Great in January 2016&lt;/strong&gt;. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. Although this book is about how companies became great but we could apply a lot of the learnings on ourselves. Concepts like level 5 leader, hedgehog concept, the stockdale paradox are equally applicable to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
